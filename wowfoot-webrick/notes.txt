On maps:
WoW maps are either continents and instances. Both those are equal from a database point-of-view.
Maps are stored in Maps.DBC, with some extra info in AreaTable.dbc.

Each map is then subdivided into a 64x64 tile grid. Not all tiles are populated.
For example, a small instance will have only one or two tiles.
Even a huge map such as Kalimdor will only have about half of the tiles populated.
I suspect that the only map that populates the majority of tiles is Outland.

A tile is stored in an ADT file.

A tile is subdivided into cells, 16x16 cells per tile.
A cell appears to be tied into a single area. If we can put a coordinate inside a cell, we will know its area.

We have functions ComputeGridPair() to get a grid from a coordinate pair, and GetAreaFlag() to further compute the cell.


On tests:
A good test suite should use the database to generate the addresses of every possible page,
except for search, which obviously has an infinite number of possible addresses.
A few hard-coded search pages should be tested.
It should retrieve those pages and ensure that it gets HTTP status 200 for the page and every linked object on that page.
(images, a hrefs, css, scripts)
It may cache the results so that pages are not tested twice per test-run.
It should not test external addresses.
