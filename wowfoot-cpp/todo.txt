** Check encoding; I think it's Latin-1, but it's presented as UTF-8 to the browser.
Example: http://localhost:3002/npc=19516
*** Seems to  be fixed.

** Redirect wowwiki links to wowpedia.
Example: http://localhost:3002/item=30450
** Done.

** Make sure document encoding is specified. We use UTF-8.
** Done.

* Make stuff more thread-safe.
** Mutex all load() operations with a single mutex.
*** Done.
** Test DLL reloading under heavy load (like the test program).
*** I've seen one crash already.

* Comment errors not caught by automated tools:
** http://localhost:3002/achievement=40
*** cranee
** http://localhost:3002/itemset=668
*** Souldivider
** http://localhost:3002/itemset=750
*** warhead0
** http://localhost:3002/npc=25881

* Comment parsing needs to be more advanced. I think we should build a DOM tree,
then run a recursive/repeating reduction pass on it, and then print it.
Slower, uses some more memory, but it's the only sane way I can think of to fix
the more advanced problems.
** Separate sections: parser, optimizer, printer.
** Printer got tangled up in the node definition.
** Remove end tag nodes; they are not needed. The start tag nodes can print their own ends.
** Done.

* Quest page seems slow. Profile, speed it up.
