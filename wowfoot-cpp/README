This is an experiment. A wowfoot server, identical in interface to wowfoot-webrick, but written in C++.

Startup time is expected to increase to 20-30 seconds, as the entire database is copied to C++ containers.
Memory usage is expected to increase to 300-600 MB.
Page serving speed is expected to increase a great deal, since NoSQL is used instead of MySQL.
Windows compatibility has increased, as this server doesn't rely on buggy Ruby implementations.
Graphics has been improved, as icons from MPQs can be accessed directly.

The server is not monolithic; it will have a core, but all the page renderers are DLLs
that can be reloaded as they change, without the need to restart the entire server.

Databases are copied from a MySQL server into hash tables. These tables are self-contained
and reloadable, much like the page renderer DLLs.

Pages are written in CHTML, an embedding format much like RHTML/erb, except this one's compiled into C++.
The CHTML compiler itself is fairly simple, and written in Ruby.
