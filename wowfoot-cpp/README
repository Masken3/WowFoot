This is an experiment. A wowfoot server, identical in interface to wowfoot-webrick, but written in C++.

Startup time is expected to increase by 20-30 seconds, as the entire database is copied to C++ containers.
Memory usage is expected to increase by 50-100 MB.
Page serving speed is expected to increase a great deal, since NoSQL is used instead of MySQL.
Windows compatibility is expected to increase, as this server won't rely on buggy Ruby implementations.
Graphics can be improved, as icons from MPQs can be accessed directly.

The server will not be monolithic; it will have a core, but all the page renderers will be DLLs
that can be reloaded as they change, without the need to restart the entire server.

Databases are copied from a MySQL server into hash tables. These tables should be self-contained
and reloadable, much like the page renderer DLLs.

Pages will be written in CHTML, an embedding format much like RHTML/erb, except this one's compiled into C++.
The CHTML compiler itself will probably be very simple, and written in Ruby.
