wowfoot is intended to be an open-source database explorer for the World of Warcraft.

It can currently display information and maps on zones, npcs, items, quests and objects.
A free-text search function is available.

Pages that remain todo:
Item sets, factions and achievements.

It should serve as a replacement for wowhead.
It should support any game version, not just the latest official patch.

It should have some improvements, for example:
* Accurate quest dependencies, read directly from the database.
* For any item that drops from npcs or objects, show possible drop-points on a map.

It is currently very unfinished and bare-bone. Feel free to fork and improve it.


Components:
* wowfoot-ex: Extracts data, including zone map images, from WoW MPQ files.
* wowfoot-downloader: Downloads pages from wowhead.
* wowfoot-import: Extracts comments from wowfoot-downloader and stores them in an sqlite3 database.
* wowfoot-webrick: A web server.
  Uses the data provided by wowfoot-ex and wowfoot-import.
  Connects to a TrinityCore world database.
* wowfoot-cpp: A web server, much like wowfoot-webrick, except written in C++.
  Has superior performance, but not yet all the features of wowfoot-webrick.


wowfoot-downloader takes a very long time to run, so its output has been collected and is available
in the download section of this github page.


It is tested on these platforms:
* Ubuntu GNU/Linux, version 10.10.
  Works fine with Ruby 1.8.
  Ruby 1.9 causes database queries to return bad data.

* Windows 7 with Ruby 1.9 and Visual Studio 2010.
  Most parts work, but the Ruby interpreter crashes when processing some pages.
  Probable cause is a bug in the MySQL client library.
