wowfoot is an open-source database explorer for the World of Warcraft.

It can currently display information and maps on zones, npcs, items, quests and objects.
A free-text search function is available.

It should serve as a replacement for wowhead.

It should support any game version, not just the latest official patch.
Currently, there's support for 1.12 and 3.3.5.

It should have some improvements, for example:
* Accurate quest dependencies, read directly from the database.
* For any item that drops from npcs or objects, show possible drop-points on a map.

It is currently very unfinished and bare-bone. Feel free to fork and improve it.


Components:
* wowfoot-ex: Extracts data, including zone map images, from WoW MPQ files.
* wowfoot-downloader: Downloads pages from wowhead.
* wowfoot-import: Extracts comments from wowfoot-downloader and stores them in an sqlite3 database.
* wowfoot-cpp: A web server, written in C++.
  Uses the data provided by wowfoot-ex and wowfoot-import.
  Connects to a TrinityCore or mangos world database.
* wowfoot-webrick: A web server, like wowfoot-cpp, written in Ruby.
  Deprecated due to instability and inferior performance.


wowfoot-downloader takes a very long time to run, so its output has been collected and is available
in the download section of this github page.


It is tested on these platforms:
* Ubuntu GNU/Linux, versions 12.04 and 12.10.

* Windows 7 with Ruby 1.9 and mingw.
